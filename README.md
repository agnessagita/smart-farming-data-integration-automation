# Data Pipeline Automation for Smart Farming from Heterogeneous Sources - Airflow, Hadoop, Metabase

Technology used: Python, Selenium, Apache Airflow, Hadoop Distributed File System, Metabase

## Abstract
Smart Farming combines Information and communication technologies (ICT) with traditional agricultural practices to improve the quality and quantity of agricultural products. These ICTs could be Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) or drones, artificial intelligence, robots, and sensors. In Smart Farming systems, various data types are needed, such as food prices, sensors, weather, images, and video. The data can be structured, semi-structured, or unstructured. Therefore, a system that can integrate Smart Farming data with versatility characteristics is needed to empower various types of analysis. In this study, the authors suggested using a Smart Farming Data Lake System based on Apache Airflow as data integration automation technology, Hadoop Distribution File System (HDFS) as data storage technology, and Metabase as dashboard technology. The evaluation result shows that all the data lake system functionality can run smoothly. In addition, the experimental results show that the implemented system can operate stably and without crashes within a time range of 1 hour with process intervals every 5 minutes.
