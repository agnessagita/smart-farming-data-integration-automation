# Metabase Dashboard thing

Metabase is Business Intelligence tools that you can create a dashboard by using a query, unlike Looker Studio/Tableau/PowerBI, you can more easier explore the data and also automatically using the template question provide by the Metabase itself.

You can set up the Java and Metabase environment before create a dashboard in Metabase, and then create a dashboard by querying for every chart, 

Here are the dashboard folder, as you can see, I provide the airflow.db too that represent the airflow performance for showing the metric such as total task, how much task success or fail, how long each dag executed time, etc. I provide the [*query*](https://github.com/Xedonedron/data-lake-for-smart-farming/blob/main/Dashboard/Metabase%20Dashboard%20Query.txt) too that I used for creating the dashboard.
